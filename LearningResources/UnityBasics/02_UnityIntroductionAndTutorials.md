# Unity Introduction

## 1. Editor Interface

The Unity Editor interface contains the following elements:

- **Scene View** – Displays the current world scene; allows visual selection, movement, and transformation of GameObjects.
- **Hierarchy** – Lists all GameObjects in the current scene. Right-click here to create new scene objects.
- **Game View** – Shows how the scene appears during play mode.
- **Inspector** – Displays components (properties) of the selected GameObject or asset.
- **Project Window** – Contains all project assets (scripts, prefabs, textures, etc.), not limited to the current scene.
- **Console** – Displays log messages, warnings, and errors from scripts and the Unity engine.
